# A simple mathematical parser and evaluator
This is a react based app built in a mathematical parser via [nearley.js](https://nearley.js.org/docs/index) and [Moo](https://github.com/no-context/moo) to evaluate an equation

## Get Started
1. run `npm install` under the project root directory
2. run `npm start` to start the app
3. enter any mathematical equation under the input and hit and `Parse & Evaluate` button
4. An AST and the parsed equation will be shown as well as the evaluated result(or error when the input is not valid)

Have fun!
